## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Add/Remove products from the cart
- Edit product quantities in the cart
- Fill in all fields in the checkout
- Receive form validations if fields are missed or incorrect during checkout
- See correct checkout totals depending on the products in the cart
  - Shipping always adds $50 to the order
  - VAT is calculated as 20% of the product total, excluding shipping
- See an order confirmation modal after checking out with an order summary
- **Bonus**: Keep track of what's in the cart, even after refreshing the browser (`localStorage` could be used for this if you're not building out a full-stack app)

## My process

1. Planning and Research

- I did a lot of research on headless ecommerce options and I originally tried to build this with CommerceLayer and Sanity but after a valiant attempt, I realized I needed more backend knowledge.

2. Setup and Configuration

- I used Vite in VSCode with several extensions to initialize the project using the React + Typescript template and created a repo with Github Desktop.

3. Challenges and Solutions

- My learning was rocketshipped with this project, especially where to start/how to begin building and structuring a larger site. I only learned this doing it the wrong way lol but what an amazing learning experience! I made the design pixel perfect in CSS using inline Tailwind first when I really should've built the functionality/bones first. I spent a lot of time redoing the CSS after I refactored a couple times, and I made sure it was very close or improved upon.
- A recurring issue I was having was dealing with the various image filepaths, and it seemed like the starter file's organization and naming wasn't conducive to streamlining things but perhaps that was intentional? Or maybe just realistic to real life scenarios. =P
- Learned a lot about how to phrase questions to AI, when I can trust answers and when I should cross-check, the different AI providers strengths, etc.
- My understanding of what makes certain ways of coding more scalable was also greatly enhanced, and I learned first hand as my website got more and more complex.
- Much, much more.

4. Coding Practices

- Adhered to coding standards and best practices, including proper naming conventions, code comments, and documentation.
- Used React hooks and functional components to manage state and lifecycle methods.
- Followed a component-based architecture for better scalability and maintainability.

5. Misc thoughts
- My background is design so I did use Photoshop to optimize some visuals.
- I also have some training on UX/UI design and was also wondering why some design decisions did not align with best practices- i.e. text size, text contrast, so instead of following perfectly I made slight changes.
- I can't wait to get a job so I can ask the questions that AI/Google doesn't answer!

Websites are never actually done!
